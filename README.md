## Yelp rating prediction

Predict the rating of a yelp restaurant based on a photo, using polars, pytorch and torchvision.

Trained on the Yelp [open dataset](https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset/).

To reproduce the results, you can run the `main.py` file.
The dataset is analysed in [`./raw_dataset_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/ascandone/yelp-prediction/blob/main/raw_dataset_analysis.ipynb) and the results are analysed in [`./predictions-analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/ascandone/yelp-prediction/blob/main/predictions-analysis.ipynb)
